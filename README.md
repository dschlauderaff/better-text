Better-text is an app designed to help track inventory for a bookstore based 
on textbook adoptions from courses. Textbooks can be added with an associated 
course, or courses and textbooks can be added separately and associated later.

The app provides login functionality using Devise, and also supports login from 
Facebook.

Functionality for ordering books and reporting are also present.
